dendropy, a python module that handles phylogenetic data structures,
including trees and dna sets. Some notes from experiments.

1. modify clades.py to produce some strings of DNA characters
   sample code in clades.py
2. insert those strings into a dictionary ("dd" for these notes)
3. use the dictionary to build a dendropy character array
   dna = dendropy.DnaCharacterMatrix.from_dict(dd)
4. get paup executable from http://www.paup.sc.fsu.edu/unix/index.html
   use it to produce a tree in dendropy
   from dendropy.interop import paup
   tree = paup.estimate_tree(dna,tree_est_criterion='nj')
   this has worked for me with some data sets but crashes on others
5. write the tree out in newick standard
   print (tree.as_string(schema="newick"))
6. display the tree as a graph
   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/treeview/tv.html
   copy/paste the newick file
   display the tree using various options for layout
   delete a few chars "[R]" at the beginning of newick string

Success with the above with 700-1000 people and character strings of
up to 16000 length, but it's not obvious the trees are meaningful

step 2 for example
dd[fname] = dnastring[:10000]
