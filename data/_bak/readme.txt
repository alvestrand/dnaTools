For the advanced user, we have made the BigY raw data files available for download. The download will be a zipped archive that contains a .vcf and a .bed file.

The VCF file contains a list of all variants found using the build 37.3 human genome reference. You can find more info about the VCF file format here:
http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41

Only variants that contain "PASS" in the "Filter" column should be considered. We include variants that did not pass our analysis standards for your informational purposes only.

The BED file contains the regions that were targeted in BigY and passed our sequencing and analysis quality control. You can find more info about the BED file format here:
