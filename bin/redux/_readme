* - cladenames.txt - automagically generated SNP names can be subsituted
* - implications.txt - this allows you to correct for no calls and other problems in the data
*   (a) forcing that any test positive for a sub-clade must be positive for its parent
    (b) (i) can (and probably should) also include two different SNPs.
        (ii) enforces Z381+ if L48+ and U106+.
    (c) can also include a number of SNPs not found in any BigY test which need to be inserted
    (d) used to denote positives in the reference genome
* - badlist.txt - snp's that should be filtered out
* - recurrencies.txt - snp's that recur. sometimes useful, sometimes not.
