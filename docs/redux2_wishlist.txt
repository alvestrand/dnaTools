Wish list / priority list:
==========================

Including other tests:
	Other tests (e.g. FGC YElite, FGC/YSeq WGS) could be included under the concept of "shared coverage"
	The coverage for each clade could be computed as the number of base pairs accurately called in two or more sub-clades
  In the case of BigY+BigY, shared coverage ~= 8.6 Mbp
  In the case of BigY+YElite, shared coverage ~= 8.6 Mbp
  In the case of YElite+YElite, shared coverage ~= 14 Mbp
  Care would need to be taken that the appropriate mutation rate was used in each case
Basic report: Identification of SNP clusters (Jim Kane's criterion: >1 SNP in 10 bp)
Programming: sort memory issues with hsort
Programming: check status of REJECTED SNPs with respect to calling and reference positives
Programming: allow implications to select based on ancestral->derived as well as position
Programming: allow recurrent SNPs to define a clade (e.g. Z3006)
Programming: prevent recurrent SNP names from becoming clade labels
HTML report: ensure clade name is prioritised (<STRONG>?)
HTML report: links to YBrowse
HTML report: list quality information
HTML report: display age information
HTML report: display Build 37 / 38 locations
HTML report: list gene information?
SVG report: fix header while scrolling
SVG report: copy haplogroup label on click
Basic report: intelligent support for "possible" clades [(?!) notation]
Basic report: include GrCh37<->GrCh38 conversion (using CrossMap?) as new column
Basic report: sorting criterion to match FTDNA tree
Basic report: parallisation / further optimisation
Basic report: ensure soft coding for number of prefix rows/columns to allow additional meta-data support
				additional columns:
					Build 38 position
					Clade's primary SNP
					Tree position
				additional rows:
					Tree position ("R1b1a1a2...")
					Lowest shared clade ("terminal SNP") 
Basic report: check and improve swapping of reference positives
Basic report: check ability to support "rejected" SNPs 	
Basic report: ability to not automatically flag some SNPs in merge-list
General: support for FGC test results
Age analysis: support for archaeological DNA / paper trail limits in the age analysis
Age analysis: should mutation rate uncertainties be added in quadrature?
				(Bearing in mind the mutation rate is partly determine from the data)
General: cross-over with STR ages - need:
				1. Calibration of STR pipeline
				2. Port of STR age pipeline to BASH
				3. SNP-STR tree encoding
				4. Age analysis merger
